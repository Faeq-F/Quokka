# Quokka
A customisable keystroke launcher

This launcher is a way of running your portable and installed apps easily. It has additional features such as opening files & folders, color conversion, translation and much more.

## Requirements:
 - A computer running Windows 7 or higher
 - A Windows defender exclusion for the location of the exe (Add exclusions to any other anti-malware software that is installed on your computer; you do not want the software to mistake the app for viruses or other malware.)

## Suggestions:
 - Setting up a task to run the launcher at startup in Task Scheduler helps ease of use as you won't need to start the program manually

## Instuctions for use:
1. Run the app and use the global shortcut (Alt + Space) to open the search bar.<br><br>
    You can search for the item you want in the search field
2. Select your item by using the arrow keys
3. Press enter to execute the shortcut

    If you wish to close the launcher, you can right-click the launcher icon in the system tray and press on 'exit'
