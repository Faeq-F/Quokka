# Quokka

An extremely customizable, portable keystroke launcher with plugins <br />
Please see the [site](https://faeq-f.github.io/Quokka/) for Available Plugins, Themes, Documentation, FAQ, etc.

### Note - this codebase is a complete rewrite of the app

The app has a plugin architecture so that, like the app per the old codebase, it can / will have additional features such as opening files & folders, color conversion, translation and much more.

I intend to make the app extremely customizable.<br>
