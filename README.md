# Quokka
A customizable keystroke launcher

This launcher is a way of running your portable and installed apps easily.

### Note - this codebase is a complete rewrite of the app
Like the app per the old codebase, it will have additional features such as opening files & folders, color conversion, translation and much more (no API keys needed!).

<b>It is intended that this app will have a Plugin Architecture</b>

Maybe using Wox plugins (though I currently have no idea how to develop that)
