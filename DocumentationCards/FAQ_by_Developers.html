  Q:
  <br />
  How do I create a task for the program in Task scheduler?
  <br />
  A:
  <br />
  Follow a guide to create a basic task, like the following

  <br />
  You will want to set it to start 'When I log on' and give 'Quokka.exe'
  (located in the root of the program folder) as the program. You do not need to
  add any arguments.
