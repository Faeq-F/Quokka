  Q:
  <br />
  How do I use a 3rd party library in my plugin?
  <br />
  <br />
  A:
  <br />
  You must install the package (likely through nuget) for your plugins project.
  Unfortunately this is not enough since Quokka will need the package reference
  of the library. You will have to use
  <a
    href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/reflection/reflection"
    >reflection</a
  >
  to load the library at runtime and use the classes it provides. You can have a
  look at the following plugins as examples as to how to do this:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="">Plugin_Calculator</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Plugin_EnglishDictionary</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Plugin_Everything</a></li>
  </ul>
