  Quokka is a portable program by design, meaning that you can place the folder
  on a external storage medium (e.g. a USB drive) and run the program from
  there.
  <br />Please see the suggestions below for an appropriate location of the
  folder.

  Suggestions:
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you do not wish to use the program in a portable manner, I suggest
      placing the folder in 'C:\Program Files', and creating a shortcut that is
      pinned to the taskbar and / or start menu.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may also want to set up a task to run the program at startup in Task
      Scheduler. Alternatively see the <a href="#FAQ">FAQ</a> on this.
